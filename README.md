# 📊 Sales & Business Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end analytics pipeline built on a synthetic retail dataset of
**100,000+ records** — raw data is cleaned and transformed with **Pandas**,
key business KPIs are analysed, and results are delivered through an
**interactive Streamlit dashboard** with drill-down filters.

> Built to demonstrate a complete data analyst workflow: data generation →
> cleaning/EDA → KPI analysis → interactive visualization.

---

## Features

- **Data cleaning pipeline** — duplicate removal, missing-value imputation,
  outlier capping (IQR method), text normalisation, feature engineering
- **KPI analysis** — monthly revenue trend, top product categories, regional
  sales performance, customer churn rate
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** with drill-down filters by date range,
  region, and product category
- **Jupyter notebook** reproducing the full EDA and KPI charts

## Tech Stack

`Python` · `Pandas` · `NumPy` · `Matplotlib` · `Seaborn` · `Streamlit` · `Scikit-learn`

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sales-analytics-dashboard.git
cd sales-analytics-dashboard
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Generate & clean the data
```bash
python src/generate_data.py   # creates data/raw_sales_data.csv
python src/clean_data.py      # creates data/cleaned_sales_data.csv
```

### 4. (Optional) Run the KPI analysis in the console
```bash
python src/analysis.py
```

### 5. Launch the dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Key Insights

- Revenue is stable month-over-month with modest seasonal fluctuation.
- Revenue is well distributed across product categories.
- Regional performance is balanced, with a slight lead for the West region.
- Roughly 1 in 5 customers falls into the churned segment — a clear target
  for retention campaigns.

## Notes on the Data

The dataset is synthetically generated (`src/generate_data.py`) to resemble
realistic retail transactions, including intentional messiness (missing
values, duplicate rows, inconsistent casing, invalid quantities) so the
cleaning pipeline has genuine issues to resolve. This keeps the project
fully reproducible and self-contained without relying on a private or
licensed dataset.
